### Data Use Protocol
HPRC goals are to develop resources for the human pangenome.  These resources will include high-quality reference genomes, a pangenome tool ecosystem along with annotation of the pangenome reference. Investigators accessing the HPRC data for their research are encouraged to collaborate with the HPRC consortium whenever possible.

### Publication Protocol
The goal of the HPRC publication policy is to encourage collaboration and coordination among investigators while ensuring the timely release of research to the scientific community.  The document provides general guidelines and a description of the process for disclosure of planned publications within the consortium through submission.  This policy will be drafted and updated by the HPRC Administration and Coordination Working Group and approved by the HPRC steering committee.
