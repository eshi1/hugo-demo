### Human Pangenome Coordinating Center
The Human Genome Reference Center at Washington University in St. Louis serves as the coordinating center. They maintain and update the reference sequence; support state-of-the-art reference representations; and educate and coordinate with the research community (including clinicians and basic research scientists).

## Human Pangenome Sequencing Center
The High-Quality Human Reference Genomes Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz collects additional DNA samples from populations not represented in the current reference, including the creation of cell lines. They will generate at least 350 high-quality reference genome sequences, a subset of which will be finished, telomere-to-telomere genome sequences. The center also disseminates the data and works closely with the other Human Genome Reference Program components.
