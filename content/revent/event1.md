## AGBT Human Pangenome Reference Workshop
This workshop is hosted by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC), one of the groups responsible for continued development of the human pangenome reference assembly. Members of the HPRC will discuss the strategic vision for implementation of pangenome resources and update the scientific community about expected improvements in the reference genome. The workshop will allow participants to gain a better understanding of GRCh38 and how to use it in their research. Members of the HPRC will also review the public resources that support the reference, including data sets and analyses that are contributing to high quality representations of human genomes. The workshop will be held on February 23rd from 10:30am to 11:30am.

### Agenda
- 10:30am to 10:45am - “State of Human Reference Genome, GRCh38” – Valerie Schneider (NCBI, Program Leader, Sequence Displays and Tools)

- 10:45am to 11am - “Technologies and Data Resources” – Tina Lindsay (Instructor, McDonnell Genome Institute, Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine)

- 11am to 11:30am - “The Human Pangenome: Diverse Human References Driving Genomic Discoveries for Everyone” – Ting Wang (Professor, Department of Genetics, McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine)
