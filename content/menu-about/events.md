## Events
### AGBT Human Pangenome Reference Workshop
This workshop was hosted by the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC), one of the groups responsible for continued development of the human pangenome reference assembly. Members of the HPRC will discuss the strategic vision for implementation of pangenome resources and update the scientific community about expected improvements in the reference genome.
